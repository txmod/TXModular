The TX Modular System - Adding TX Classes to SuperCollider  3

The TX Modular system uses various classes which SuperCollider needs to know about in order to run the system.

First, download the latest TX Modular SuperCollider classes from: http://palemoonrising.co.uk
 
To add TX Modular system classes to SuperCollider, first open SuperCollider and in the File menu click on “Open user support directory”.
From inside that, open the “Extensions” folder.
If you have an older “TX_Mod_Extensions” folder there then delete it first.
Then copy the supplied folder “TX_Mod_Extensions” into your “Extensions” folder .

You also need to add the sc3-plugins folder into your Extensions folder. Download the latest version for your platform from: https://supercollider.github.io/sc3-plugins).

You also need to install a SuperCollider Quark called wslib. 
To install wslib, in SuperCollider, run the code:
     Quarks.gui;
This opens the Quarks window. 
Now go to the end of the  list of quarks and click on the + button next to wslib
 (see Quarks help file for more details)

After all the previous steps, you need to recompile SuperCollider:
In SuperCollider, click on the menu option Language and select “Recompile class library” (or if you prefer, quit and restart SuperCollider).

Now you have everything installed, to open TX Modular, in SuperCollider open the file “Start_TX_Modular.scd” and run the code:
   TXSystem1.start;
