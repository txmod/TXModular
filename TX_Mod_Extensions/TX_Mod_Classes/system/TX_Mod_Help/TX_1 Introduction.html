<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>1. Background</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The TX Modular System is open source audio-visual software for modular synthesis and video generation, built with SuperCollider and openFrameworks.</p>
<p class="p2">It was designed and written between 2002 and 2020. Starting as a few ideas for a MIDI-controlled synth, and inspired by analogue modular systems and digital keyboards such as samplers and FM synths, it quickly expanded to become a modular system.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It includes various modules, such as: waveform generators, multi-track & step sequencers, sample & loop players, envelope generators, wavetable synths, filters, noise generators, LFOs, delays, compressors, gates, flangers, pitch-shifters, reverbs, vocoders, distortion, ring modulation, file recorders and file players. <br>
(For a full list see: <a href="file:TX_Intro%20to%20All%20Modules.html"><span class="s3">Intro to All Modules</span></a>)</span>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is also a video modular app called TXV which is controlled by and linked to the TX Modular system. TXV has it's own modules generating 2D and 3D visuals. TXV modules can use imported images, movies, 3D models and text and add various real-time FX - such as image blur, colour manipulation and masking. <br>
(For more on TXV see: <a href="file:../../TXV/TXV%20HelpFiles/TX_TXV_General_Introduction.html">TXV General Introduction</a>)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">External controllers can be connected the system - such as a MIDI keyboard, slider, joystick, iPad, ribbon controller, or foot pedal. OSC (Open Sound Control) messages can be sent to and from the system across a local network or through the internet. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The audio part of the TX Modular System is written in the SuperCollider programming language (</span><span class="s4">http:supercollider.github.io</span><span class="s1">). However, you don't need to know how to program in SuperCollider to use it. If, on the other hand, you can program in SuperCollider, there are various modules which allow you to add your own code for audio generation or animation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I hope there is enough information in these help files for you to begin experimenting and creating.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thanks for all bug reports and new module suggestions. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For assistance in creating this system, big thanks to: Matthew Dennis, Gerald Dennis, Zachary De Santos, Matt Black, and the amazing SuperCollider community, especially James Harkins (for advice, bug fixes and new code).</span></p>
