<p class="p2"><b>Release 089 (August 2020)</b></p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p2">This release includes various new modules, bug fixes and other small changes (such as Channels can now have their meters turned on or off individually), but the biggest addition is a new visual app called TXV.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>TXV</b> is a modular video system for generating real-time 2D & 3D visuals. It was created to enable a TX Modular user to control both video and audio processes, and link them together.<br>
TXV is a separate application from the TX Modular. It is controlled by the TX Modular using a new module called TXV System, which is used to add TXV modules and connect them together in various ways. As TXV modules are added, they appear in the TX Modular and can be edited, automated or modulated.</p>
<p class="p2">The TXV app has no user interface of its own - it simply waits for instructions of what to do from the TX Modular (sent as OSC messages), and then outputs the result as live video or recorded to disk.</p>
<p class="p2"><b><i>Note:</i></b> At the time of writing, there are builds of TXV for MacOS & Windows. However, the MacOS build will not work on 10.15 Catalina (or later MacOS versions).<br>
TXV is written in C++ and GLSL using OpenFrameworks 0.9.8. Since OpenFrameworks is cross-platform it may be possible for an OpenFrameworks user with relevent knowledge to build TXV on   Linux (although this hasn't been tested yet).</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p2"><b><i>New TX modules:</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>NHHall & NHHall St</b> [Insert Modules category: Audio: Reverb]<br>
General-purpose mono & stereo reverbs. Random modulation adds lush chorus effects to the sound.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p2"><b>TXV System</b> [ModulationSource DrawDestination]<br>
This module controls a separate piece of software - an app called TXV which is a modular video system for generating real-time 2D & 3D visuals. It was created to enable a TX Modular user to control both video and audio processes, and link them together.<br>
TXV opens in it's own window and is controlled by adding a TXV System module to the TX Modular.<br>
TXV System has various sections for controlling TXV - such as to connect to TXV, rebuild a saved system, or change the master BPM. You can also add new modules, connect them together for drawing or modulation, and add assets - such as images or movies - to the system.</p>
<p class="p2"><b><i>New TXV modules:</i></b></p>

<p class="p2"><b>-----------------------------------------------------</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Release 088 (December 2018)</b></p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p2">This release includes various new modules, bug fixes and other changes:. </p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p2"><b><i>New modules:</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>CompanderMB & CompanderMB St</b> <br>
[Insert Modules category: Audio: Dynamics]<br>
- Multiband compander - splits the input signal into 4 frequency bands with a compander on each band which can function as a compressor or expander/ gate.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>DistortionMB & DistortionMB St</b> <br>
[Insert Modules category: Audio: Distortion]<br>
- Multiband distortion - splits the input signal into 4 frequency bands and adds distortion, giving a roughness and/or warmth to the signal.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>FM Filter & FM Filter St</b> <br>
[Insert Modules category: Audio: EQ & Filter]<br>
- Filters audio signals using a resonant filter. Frequency modulation (internal or external) can be used to add complexity to the sound.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Freq Shift & Freq Shift St</b> <br>
[Insert Modules category: Audio: Pitch & Freq Shift]<br>
'Freq Shift implements single sideband amplitude modulation, also known as frequency shifting, but not to be confused with pitch shifting.'<br>
'Frequency shifting moves all the components of a signal by a fixed amount but does not preserve the original harmonic relationships.'<br>
Frequency modulation (internal or external) is optional</p>
<p class="p2"><b>LFO Pulse</b> <br>
[Source Modules category: Control: Modulation]<br>
- Low Frequency Oscillator that outputs a 'pulse' waveform, where a proportion of the signal will have a value of 1 and the rest a value 0. The proportion depends on the pulse width.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>PolyNote Trigger</b> <br>
[Source Modules category: Control: Note Tools]<br>
- PolyNote Trigger can be used to trigger notes in up to 6 polyphonic modules using a control signal from another module, such as Clock Pulse, LFO or Step Sequencer, or using an Action Button on an Interface Screen.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Rotate St</b> <br>
[Insert Modules category: Audio: Channel Tools]<br>
- Rotates a stereo input signal in the stereo field, with both manual and automatic rotation available; can be used to add movement to a stereo signal, creating amplitude modulation effects at higher rotation frequencies.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>SoftKnee CompMB & SoftKnee CompMB St</b> <br>
[Insert Modules category: Audio: Dynamics]<br>
- Multiband compressor - splits the input signal into 4 frequency bands with a compressor on each band which reduces the level of the louder parts of signal. It has the effect of evening out the volume. The type of compression can be changed from Peak Compression to RMS Compression, which responds to a signal over a settable averaging time.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Split 2-Band, Split 2-Band St,  <br>Split 4-Band, Split 4-Band St,  <br>Split 8-Band, Split 8-Band St</b><br>
[Source Modules category: Audio: Split]<br>
- Split an audio signal into 2/4/8 frequency bands.<br>
<p class="p2"><b>Strum</b> <br>
[Source Modules category: Control: Note Tools]<br>
- Strum can output trigger pulses and trigger notes in up to 6 polyphonic modules. Whenever, the strum position is moved or modulated, it triggers notes in the current scale - either a preset scale, such as 'Major' or 'Minor', or a Custom Scale which is editable.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Trig to Gate</b> <br>
[Insert Modules category: Control: Modify].<br>
- Trig to Gate converts a 'trigger' into a 'gate’. When a trigger is received (when a control signal changes from zero or below to above zero), it outputs a gate signal (level set to 1) for a specific length of time.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b><i>Bug fixes include:</i></b></p>
<p class="p2">- Fixed bug with All Notes Off button so non-polyphonic modules are unaffected.</p>
<p class="p2">- Fixed white-on-white text color issues when using a dark color theme in SuperCollider IDE.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b><i>Other changes include:</i></b></p>
<p class="p2">All <b>Envelope</b> modules (mono & polyphonic) now have an 'Env End Trig' output which sends a trigger when the envelope ends.</p>
<p class="p2"> <b>Curve Editing</b> has been enhanced - when drawing lines, if the <b>Shift</b> button is down when the mouse button is pressed, a line is drawn from the last drawn point to the current mouse point. This allows a chain of points to be linked together. </p>
<p class="p2"><b>Loop Player & Loop Player St</b> have been enhanced: <br>
There's new loop type: 'Single shot - play whole loop'.<br>
Envelope parameters have been added for Attack, Release and Envelope curve.<br>
New Feel & Groove curves can change the level, timing & pitch of the loop while it plays. There are 2 curves each for Feel & Groove which can be morphed.<br>
Groove curves can also rearrange the order of the beats in a loop, or reverse them.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Mono Env Curve</b> has a  new Gate mode:  'Looped with forced release' which is a gated & looped envelope with variable close time.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Pitch Shifter & Pitch Shifter St</b> have been rebuilt and renamed <b>Pitch Shift & Pitch Shift St.</b><br>
The new versions have a Pitch Shift (in semitones) replacing the old Pitch Ratio so musical intervals can be created more easily.<br>
<b>Pitch Shift St</b> also has Stereo Shift which shifts the left and right channels’ pitch in opposite directions. This can be used for stereo detuning.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Pluck Synth</b> has a  new Pick type:  'Pluck input - Use pluck input for pick sound' which uses  external audio from another module or bus to create the initial pick sound. This allows for a much greater range of pluck sounds to be created.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Sample & Loop Banks</b>:<br>
When a saved system is opened, an error window will appear if there are any sample or loop banks with missing samples or loops.<br>
There are new buttons 'Search folder for missing samples/loops' & 'Replace selected sample/loop' so any sample/loop in a bank (missing or not) can be replaced with another one.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>X-Fader</b> modules now have editable cross-fade curves, including some DJ-oriented preset curves, to control the mix as the cross-fader moves.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Release 087 (January 2018)</b></p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p2">This release includes many new modules, lots of them coming from recent additions to SuperCollider (see full list below). </p>
<p class="p2">A redesign of the interface gives a more flexible screen layout with sliding panels, meters on every channel (with a new narrow option to display more channels), and easier gui interface building by importing gui widgets directly from modules.</p>
<p class="p2">As well as various bug fixes, the code has been refactored enabling many more modules to be added.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>

When it is triggered, it restricts the output notes to a particular key and scale (if the chromatic scale is chosen, then any notes played are be part of the scale). <br>
Optionally, a chord can be played instead of just a single note . An open version of the chord can be chosen, with selectable octave transposition to spread the chord. Each note in the chord has both velocity and probability settings, allowing randomness to be introduced in various ways.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>

<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>3. </b><b>Audio Insert Modules</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Distortion</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Interference (mono &amp; stereo) - </b>adds 'interference' to the input signal by using up to 3 regular or noisy waveforms to modulate a short delay line.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>WaveFold (mono &amp; stereo)</b> - distorts the input signal, by boosting the gain (amplitude) and adding harmonics using 4 layers of folding, wrapping, or clipping.</p>

<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Dynamics</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Amp Comp</b> <b>(mono &amp; stereo)</b> - Psychoacoustic amplitude compensation - frequency-dependent amplitude reduction, the level of the input signal is reduced for higher frequencies.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Balance</b> <b>(mono &amp; stereo)</b> - sets the incoming audio to be at the same level as one of two options: 1) the Target level, 2) the level of the mono audio side-chain signal.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Noise Gate (mono &amp; stereo) -</b> can be used as a gate or ducker with an optional side-chain input. Reduces the level of the input signal when the level of the input or side-chain goes below (gate) or above (ducker) a certain threshold.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>SoftKnee Comp (mono &amp; stereo) - </b>responds to the amplitude (volume level) of an audio signal coming into it. A compressor reduces the level of the louder parts of signal. It has the effect of evening out the volume. The type of compression can be changed from Peak Compression to RMS Compression, which responds to a signal over a settable averaging time.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>EQ & Filter</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Bracket EQ (mono &amp; stereo)</b> - this can "bracket" the frequencies of a sound, removing frequencies that are below the low-cut frequency or above the high-cut frequency.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Dual Filter  (mono &amp; stereo)</b> - uses 1 or 2 filters combined in various ways to cut or boost certain frequencies in an audio signal.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>EQ6 (mono &amp; stereo)</b> - 6 switchable bands of EQ: Lo-shelf, Parametric 1 - 4, &amp; Hi-shelf, with +/- 15db gain per band.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>EQ Morph (mono &amp; stereo)</b> -  morph between 2-5 EQ presets using 6 switchable bands of EQ: Lo-shelf, Parametric, or Hi-shelf, with +/- 15db gain per band.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Gain Envelope</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Gain 16 Stage (mono &amp; stereo) - </b>applies a 16-stage envelope to the input signal.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Gain Curve (mono &amp; stereo) - </b>applies a user-defined envelope to the input signal. The curve can be edited with a mouse.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Gain DADSR (mono &amp; stereo) - </b>applies a DADSR (Delay Attack Decay Sustain Release) envelope to the input signal.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Gain DADSSR (mono &amp; stereo) - </b>applies a DADSSR (Delay Attack Decay Sustain1 Sustain2 Release) envelope to the input signal.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Granulation</b></p>

<p class="p2"><b>Bowed Res (mono)</b> - digital wave guide physical model of a soundboard resonator for a bowed instrument.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Formlets (mono)</b> - uses a group of 1-8 resonant filters to add formants to the input signal. The filter impulse response is like that of a sine wave with an attack-decay envelope over it.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Klank (mono)</b> - uses a group of 1-8 frequency resonators on to the input signal - with controls for frequency, ring time and amplitude. </p>
<p class="p2"><b>Membrane (mono)</b> - uses the input signal to excite a physical model of a drum-like membrane, based on triangular waveguide meshes of a hexagon or circle.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Piano Res St (stereo)</b> - digital wave guide physical model of a piano soundboard.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Strings (mono)</b> - uses the input signal to excite Karplus-Strong models of a group of 1-8 strings. When a trigger is received, the strings are 'plucked' using a short burst of the input signal to excite the strings.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Tubes (mono)</b> - uses the input signal to excite a physical model of a tube made up of 2-8 sections. </p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Reverb</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Greyhole (mono &amp; stereo)</b> - 'A complex echo-like effect … a diffuser (like a mini-reverb) connected in a feedback system with a long modulated delay-line. Excels at producing spacey washes of sound.' (from SC help)</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Infinity (mono &amp; stereo)</b> - adds a long, smeared wash to the input signal using multiple all-pass delays. Maximum feedback produces infinite sustain.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>JPverb (mono &amp; stereo)</b> - 'An algorithmic reverb, inspired by the lush chorused sound of certain vintage Lexicon and Alesis reverberation units. Designed to sound great with synthetic sound sources, rather than sound like a realistic space.' (from SC help)</p>

</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Spectral</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Spectral Delay</b> - adds separate delays, of up to 1 second, to the input signal in 256 different frequency bands. The delay time for every band is set by editing a curve showing Frequency on the X-axis and Delay Time on the Y-axis.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Synthesis</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Sub Harm (mono &amp; stereo) -</b> adds 4 pulse-wave sub-harmonics to a mono audio signal. Each sub-harmonic is progressively lower. A filter cuts or boost frequencies to shape the output signal.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>4. Control Insert </b><b>Modules</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Analysis</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Changed Trig</b> - whenever the input signal changes, a very short trigger pulse is output. </p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Modify</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Quantise - </b>quantises the input signal to a set number of equally placed steps. </p>

<p class="p2"><b>-----------------------------------------------------</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Release 082 (January 2012)</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b><i>Highlights:</i></b></p>
<p class="p2">Building a system is quicker, with fewer mouse clicks.</p>
<p class="p2">Interface building is also much easier and more flexible.</p>
<p class="p2">Note Stacker makes building multi-layered instruments much easier.</p>
<p class="p2">OSC Remote is useful for remote control by phone, tablet, &amp; other OSC devices.</p>
<p class="p2">Sample Player + (similar to Wave Synth +) adds many more possibilities to sample-based instruments.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b><i>The following new modules have been built:</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Convolution</b> (mono &amp; stereo) - Convolution uses impulse response samples to simulate reverbs, filters/EQ, microphones, speakers, amplifiers and for special effects.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Env Follow </b>(mono &amp; stereo) - this audio insert module matches the level of an audio signal to another audio signal that is being fed into the side-chain input.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Matrix A 8x8 / Matrix C 8x8</b> - These audio &amp; control modules mix 8 input signals into 8 output channels using a 64-knob matrix.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Mix Audio 8-1 / Mix Audio 16-2 / Mix Control 8-1- </b>These modules mix 8 mono audio signals / 8 stereo audio signals / 8 control signals.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Mono to Stereo</b> - Converts a mono audio signal into a stereo signal by panning between the left and right channels.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>M-S Encoder </b>- this takes a stereo audio signal and converts into mid and side signals.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>M-S Decoder </b>- this takes mid and side signals and converts them into a stereo audio signal.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Note Stacker - </b>this triggered module makes no sound itself but instead triggers notes in other modules, with the option of modifying the pitch or velocity of the notes for various effects.</p>
<p class="p2">Up to 18 different modules can be triggered, arranged in 6 layers each with 3 output modules. The modules on a layer can be played together, rotated each time the layers is played, or randomly chosen. Each layer has curves for modifying the overall velocity response, as well as individual note level and tuning for each note across the keyboard range.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>OSC Control 2D -</b> outputs two control signals from OpenSound Control ('OSC') messages received.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>OSC Remote - </b>This<b> </b>module is designed for linking up an external device that sends multiple OSC messages - such as a phone or an iPad running TouchOSC, or another computer running the TX Modular system or other OSC software. Each OSC String is linked to an Action within the TX.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Sample Player+ (mono &amp; stereo) - </b>this is an enhanced version of the Sample Player module which includes a filter, 2 LFOs, an extra assignable envelope and a modulation matrix.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Transient Shape (mono &amp; stereo)</b> - this has replaced the Transient module. Attack and sustain of incoming audio can be separately controlled with the divide frequency affecting how attack and release are separated. Useful with drums, plucked and percussive sounds which have strong transients.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>X-Fader 2-1 C</b> (control source) module - for modulatable cross-fading between 2 control signals.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b><i>Module changes include:</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Action Slider </b>module - now includes various triggering options based on the direction of movement of the slider.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Gain</b> modules (mono/stereo) - new Phase Invert<b> </b>buttons for inverting the phase of audio signals.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Group Morph </b>module -<b> </b>this now has various 2D and Linear types of morph.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>MIDI Sustain Pedal and Pitchbend- </b>All Triggered Audio Source Modules now respond to Sustain Pedal and Pitchbend MIDI messages when MIDI Listen is activated.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Step Sequencer</b> is the new name for <b>Note Sequencer </b>- it was renamed for clarity since it sequences control values, velocities &amp; notes using steps.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Perlin Noise </b>module - a new control Rate Multiply has been added which controls the overall speed of the noise.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b><i>Other changes include:</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Audio Setup Window </b>- when the TX Modular system starts, this window opens first to set the Audio Device (i.e. Sound Card), and its Sample Rate and Buffer Size.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Volume slider &amp; 0dB button</b> - to set the overall output level for the system.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>History buttons &lt; &gt;</b> - to navigate to a previously viewed screen</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Interface Design improvements - GUI Properties</b> is now a floating window above the new <b>Design Interface</b> window which displays all widgets as you move or resize them.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Interface Screens: Background Images</b> - Each Interface screen can have its own background image with widgets displayed over it.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>New Interface Widget: Knob -</b> knobs take up less space than sliders for editing numerical parameters.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Sample Banks &amp; Loop Banks</b> - there are now 99 Sample &amp; Loop Banks available for more flexibility when creating larger systems (previously there was only 1 Sample &amp; 1 Loop Bank).</p>
<p class="p2"><b>SuperCollider users</b> <b>-</b> should find that TX Modular classes can be used more easily with multiple Quarks installed since the TX Modular uses many fewer class variables than before.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>TX Autonomous Standalone Systems</b> - It is now possible to make a copy of the TX Modular Standalone and modify it so that it automatically loads a pre-saved system. An autonomous system can't be edited or saved, and only the Interface screens are shown, so it's like a play-only version of a prebuilt TX Modular instrument or system. This might be useful for creating installations or easily distributable live instruments. The pre-saved system file and any external files are enclosed within the self-contained app so it's easy to give a standalone to other people. A Help file explains this in detail.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>User Options</b> - shown on the Notes &amp; Options screen, for choosing overall window colour &amp; transparency, adding a background image to the main window, and whether to ask for confirmation before deleting Modules and Channels.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>-----------------------------------------------------</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Release 081 (August 2010)</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b><i>Main changes in this release:</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>New Signal Flow window -</b> this window is designed to make it easier to see how a whole system works. It shows how audio and control signals flow around the system between modules, channels and busses. As you add modules and connect them together in the Modules window, they will automatically be added to the Signal Flow window. Blue lines show audio signals and green lines show control signals. The layout of the Signal Flow window can be easily changed (by clicking and dragging).</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Interface improvements</b> - The Design Layout window has been improved so you can easily resize widgets by dragging their corners and you can select multiple widgets for moving or cloning. This makes it much faster to design an interface. It is now possible to change the size of the Inteface so more controls can be displayed on larger monitors.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Preset Files - </b>All modules can have their settings saved as Preset Files, which can be reloaded at a later time. This also makes it easier to copy module settings between different systems. Presets are saved or loaded using the Do... popup button which is on the top row of each module's control window.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Main window -</b> the overall layout has been simplified. All the buttons for system and inteface windows now appear together on the second row.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Modules window -</b> this has a new, simpler layout. A list of all modules in the system is now shown on the left. There is easier navigation through channels using a scroll bar.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Note Sequencer - </b>this has had many changes including: a new Play Mode that allows manual triggering of sequencer steps; interface improvements; individual parameters can be randomised; BPM can be modulated directly using a control signal; there are 3 new control outputs which can be sequenced alongside notes in each step; MIDI output for notes and 3 controller values;</p>
<p class="p2"><br>

<p class="p2"><b>Meters</b> - this new popup, on the top right of the window, allows you to select any module or bus in the system and display its output(s) on a meter. Meters are on separate movable windows. Audio signals are shown in loudness units (-90dB to 0dB); Control signals are shown directly (range -1 to +1).</p>
<p class="p2">All <b>numbers</b> displayed in the TX Modular screens are now <b>scrolling numbers</b> - click on them and drag up/down, left/right to change their values.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Window layout</b> - various improvements have been made to make the user interface clearer and easier to use.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Sync Start</b> + <b>Sync Stop</b> + <b>Stop All </b>- these 3 buttons appear at the top of the window. They allow Sequencers, Fle Players and File Recorders to be started and stopped together. Each sequencer, file player and recorder can be individually set to respond to Sync Start and Sync Stop instructions. Stop All will ask all modules to stop regardless of their Sync Start and Sync Stop settings.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Modules &amp; Channels</b> - are now merged into one <b>Modules </b>window.<b> </b>Modules are displayed on the left hand side with Channels on the right. If no module is selected, a list of all modules currently in the system is shown.</p>
<p class="p2">The channel number of first displayed channel is shown next to channel arrow keys. This can be edited or scrolled as an alternative to using the arrow keys.</p>
<p class="p2">It is now possible to change a channel's source (when a channel is in edit mode).</p>
<p class="p2">All Modules &amp; Channels now have a blank text line for users to add their own notes.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b><i>Various new modules have been built:</i></b></p>

<p class="p2"><b>OSC Control Out</b> - this<b> </b>module sends an OSC message to up to 10 different network addresses. The OSC messages have 2 arguments, the OSC string and the control value. The control value can be modulated. This allows communication across a network to other TX Modular systems running on other computers, or to any software (such as Processing &amp; Max/MSP) that can respond to OSC messages.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Pitch Follower</b> - this follows the pitch of a mono audio signal coming into it.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Quartz Player</b> - this creates a new window containing any Quartz Composer Composition which can be controlled by the the TX Modular system. This can be used with other modules to create interactive and/or automated audio-visual systems. (Quartz Composer is a very powerful visual engine that comes free with OS X.)</p>
<p class="p2"><b>ReverbA, ReverbF, ReverbF St, ReverbG</b> - these are various new mono and stereo reverbs with different sound characters.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Wave Synth Plus</b> - this is an expanded version of the Wave Synth module which also includes a filter, 2 LFOs, an extra envelope and a modulation matrix.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Wii Ctrl Darwiin</b> - this module outputs a control signal based on a selected Wii or Nunchuck control, including: acceleration, rotation, button and IR camera data. To use this module, you will need the free software <i>DarwiinRemote OSC</i>.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Wii Ctrl OSC</b> - this module outputs a control signal based on a selected Wii or Nunchuck control, including: acceleration, rotation, button and IR camera data. To use this module, you will need the software <i>OSCulator</i>.</p>

<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b><i>Other changes include:</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Note Sequencer </b>- the interface has been improved by creating a new Piano Roll window to edit notes as well as any of the other parameters for each step - velocity, probablity, delay, etc.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Compander</b> - there is now an option to use a side chain to control the compander.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Filter</b> - several new filter types have been added (including various Moog and TB303 emulations).</p>
<p class="p2"><b>MIDI Control Out</b> - this module sends out MIDI controller messages and has been improved. (Note: This has now become an Action module - in previous releases it was a Control Insert module).</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Table Synth</b> - two new parameters - harmonic gap and scaling - give more flexibility in defining wavetables .</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Waveform</b> - It is now possible to use a note list instead of having a variable frequency. Using a note list forces the frequency of the waveform to conform to the notes of a selected scale/ mode/ chord in a chosen key - this is the same as quantizing the frequency to a scale. The note list position can be modulated.</p>

<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Release 074 (December 2007)</b></p>
<p class="p2">Changes include:</p>
<p class="p2">For simplicity, all releases are now given a 3-digit number.</p>
<p class="p2">The <b>Stereo Loop Player</b> can now play both mono and stereo loops.</p>
<p class="p2">The <b>Stereo Sample Player</b> can now play both mono and stereo samples.</p>
<p class="p2">Various <b><i>new modules</i></b> have been built:</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Action Sequencer</b> - this can trigger all kinds of actions at specific times. Actions are commands or instructions for any modules in the system, such as changing the settings of any module in the system, triggering notes to play, starting and stopping other sequencers.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>CyclOSC Colour</b> - this module analyses video data coming in from a video camera to check for the presence of a particular target colour which you can set.</p>
<p class="p2">You can also to define a zone which means that the target is looked for in only certain parts of the video grid. This is useful for triggering events only when a target colour enters a space. For example, by adding multiple modules you can create colour-sensitive hot-zones in an interactive performance or installation space.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>CyclOSC Grey</b> - this module is similar to CyclOSC Colour except it looks for a shade of grey instead of a colour.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>EQ Graphic </b>(audio insert) module - adjust the EQ of an audio signal.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>OSC Out</b> - this<b> </b>module sends an OSC message to up to 10 different network addresses. This allows communication across a network to other TX Modular systems running on other computers, or to any software (such as Processing &amp; Max/MSP) that can respond to OSC messages.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>OSC Trigger</b> - this can trigger up to 10 actions when OSC messages are received as long as the OSC message begins with a string that matches the OSC string on the screen. OSC message arguments can be passed to the actions.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>OSC Controller - </b>outputs a control signal from OpenSound Control ('OSC') messages received. (This came out in a previous release, but I forgot to mention it.)</p>
<p class="p2"><b>QC Particles</b> - this module creates a new window which contains a video screen running a 3D particle system animation.</p>

<p class="p2">A <b>Help </b>system has now been completed, with specific help buttons in every module.</p>
<p class="p2">The opening of saved systems is much faster now (±3 times as quick).</p>
<p class="p2">In many modules there are now <b>presets</b> for things like envelope shapes or frequency ranges.</p>
<p class="p2">Various <b><i>new modules</i></b> have been built:</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Audio Trigger</b> (control source) - triggers other modules when the amplitude (volume level) of audio coming into it goes above a certain level.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Filter Synth </b>(audio source) module - creates triggered filters (from MIDI or sequencers) which use an audio side chain for input. Each filter is velocity-sensitive and has its own envelope - like the wave synth module</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Sample and Hold</b> (control insert) module for triggered sampling the levels of a control source - this can also function as a Gate and Hold unit for other effects .</p>
<p class="p2"><b>StereoWidth </b>(audio insert) module - allows stereo width to be changed.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Transient</b> (audio insert) module - transient shaper, limits the slope of an audio signal.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Trigger Impulse</b> (control source) module - creates short trigger impulses, for example to trigger the new Sample and Hold module. This can be sequenced or triggered via MIDI.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>X-Fader</b> (audio source) module - mono and stereo versions allow modulatable cross-fading between 2 audio signals.</p>
<p class="p2"><b><i>Other changes</i></b> include:</p>
<p class="p2">The <b>Sequencer</b> has been renamed <b>Note Sequencer</b> and has had various enhancements. On the new global tab, there are buttons to mute the output, to use a random trigger (as opposed to a clock) based on the BPM, and an option to randomise the step order every cycle. Sequencer steps can now be put into up to 8 groups so that they can be controlled by widgets on the Front Interface screens - this makes the sequencer dynamically controllable - good for gestural control while playing.</p>
<p class="p2">The <b>File Player</b> mono/stereo modules have been improved with better control capability from interface screens.</p>
<p class="p2">The <b>Waveform </b>module now has a stereo version with a beats frequency control for wide stereo effects or for creating binaural beats.</p>

<p class="p2"><br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Release 0.10.6 (August 2006)</b></p>
<p class="p2">As well as fixing various bugs, this version has an more streamlined main window and a new <b>interface</b> system where users can design a front screen with objects that can control multiple modules. I haven't yet had time to update the other help files with details of how to use the new interface system. There are some examples which use the new interface, so have a look at those to get an idea of how you could use it.</p>
<p class="p2">The <b>sequencer</b> module is now much more powerful: It can now have up to 64 steps (used to be 16), there is a new delay option for making individual steps late (as in swing patterns), you can now chain patterns together, and you can apply all kinds of processes to patterns including generating new ones from many types of scales.</p>
<p class="p2">A new <b>Table Synth</b> module has been built which allows you to create wavetables by mixing harmonics in various proportions. You can have up to 8 wavetables and smoothly mix between them.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>
