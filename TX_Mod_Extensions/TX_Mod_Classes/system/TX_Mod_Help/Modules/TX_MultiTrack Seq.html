</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Introduction:</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This module can be used to record, edit, and play back multiple Controller and Note Tracks to control parameters of other modules or send them note triggers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Each track can record from MIDI input and have up to 6 output modules, as well as MIDI output.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Controller Tracks can also record direct input - from a slider, for example on the interface, or from one of 16 available modulation inputs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note tracks can send output to polyphonic source modules, such as synths or polyphonic envelopes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Basic MIDI file import/export is available with BPM on a separate tempo track, although time signature changes in MIDI files are ignored when importing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are several examples that come with TX Modular system which show various ways to use the MultiTrack Sequencer <br>
<i>(see TX_Mod_Examples/Specific_examples/MultTrackSeq...)</i>.</span></p>

<b><i>Note Track Edit Controls:</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Inputs &amp; Outputs </b>button - this shows controls for setting inputs &amp; outputs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Note:</i> Note tracks can only use MIDI as their input source.To be able to record another sequencer module within the TX Modular, set it’s output to MIDI loopback to bring the MIDI data back in. Then set the recording track to listen to the correct MIDI input channel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>MIDI Learn</b> - automatically selects the Midi Channel based on incoming MIDI data. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>MIDI Loop-Back </b>- sends MIDI notes back into the TX Modular system on the selected channel, so other modules can respond. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Note: </i>Take care not to output MIDI loop-back to a channel that the module itself is listening to - otherwise the system will <b>crash</b> with a MIDI feedback loop!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>MIDI Channel</b> - output channel (1-16).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">—</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Draw Notes </b>button - this shows all notes on a grid, with an optional velocity track below it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To add a note, click in the grid at the start of the note and drag to the right to set the note length. Dragging up or down will change the velocity of the note, which is also represented by the colour of the note. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the velocity track is shown, once you have drawn a note, you can drag the black dot at the top of the velocity line to change it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Various <b>Snap grid</b> controls are taken into account when drawing or editing. They are specific for <i>each track</i> in the sequencer.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Edit Notes </b>button - this looks similar to <b>Draw Notes</b> but with more controls. In this view you can select multiple notes and run processes on them (Copy, Cut, Paste, etc.). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To select notes, you can drag over notes in the note grid, or in the velocity track, or if the <b>auto select</b> checkbox is on (located above the MIDI keyboard graphic), by <i>shift-dragging</i> in the Timeline Ruler. Use shift and drag to add notes to the current selection.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If only a single note is selected, all the note properties (MIDI note, start/end position, velocity %) are shown in editable boxes below the velocity track for precise editing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Selected notes can be altered by dragging the start position line, end position line, or main body of the note. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the velocity track is shown, dragging the black dot at the top of the velocity line will change it. If many notes are selected, they will be scaled proportionately when changing velocities.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The left edge of the grid shows minimum &amp; maximum values as well as quantise steps as text.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If Output Parameter 1 has been assigned (see Inputs &amp; Outputs button), the equivalent value of that parameter is also shown on the left (i.e. some parameters have values that aren’t in the range 0-1, so they will be shown mapped to their relevant range).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Various <b>Snap grid</b> controls are taken into account when drawing or editing. They are specific for <i>each track</i> in the sequencer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are range (= zoom) controls for bars displayed and controller values displayed above and to the right of the grid.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Quantise Value</b> - if set on, all drawn values will be quantised based on the value of <b>Quantise Steps.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Mouse drag draws multiple points</b> - if set off, a single point will be drawn at the final mouse position at the end of the drag. This makes it easier for fine control of a single point’s position.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">—</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Draw Lines </b>button - similar to <b>Draw Points</b>, this is for drawing lines or curves with a specific shape.</span></p>
