</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Module type: Action</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Introduction:</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This triggered module makes no sound itself but instead triggers notes in other polyphonic modules. Up to 6 different modules can be triggered. It can also output MIDI notes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it is triggered, it restricts the output notes to a particular key and scale (if the chromatic scale is chosen, then any notes played are be part of the scale).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Optionally, a chord can be played instead of just a single note . An open version of the chord can be chosen, with selectable octave transposition to spread the chord. Each note in the chord has both velocity and probability settings, allowing randomness to be introduced in various ways.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Controls:</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Active</b> - if off then no notes will be triggered<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>MIDI &amp; Outputs button</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>MIDI Listen</b> - this allows the module to be triggered by midi Notes, and to respond to midi Pitchbend.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Note</b>: If Midi Listen is turned on make sure none of the individual output modules has their Midi Listen turned on, or there will be double triggering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>MIDI Channels</b> - which midi channels the module will listen to.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Modules </b>- up to 6 polyphonic source modules, such as wave synths, samplers or polyphonic envelopes, can be triggered. All valid modules will appear in the modules list. See the <a href="file:../TX_0%20TX%20Modular%20Help.html"><span class="s3">Help Index</span></a> for details of which modules are polyphonic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Output MIDI notes</b> - on/off.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>MIDI Port </b>- select from available ports</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>MIDI Loop-Back </b>- sends MIDI notes back into the TX Modular system on the selected channel, so other modules can respond.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Note</b>:<b> </b>Take care not to output MIDI loop-back to a channel that the module itself is listening to - otherwise the system will crash with a MIDI feedback loop.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>MIDI Channel</b> - output channel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>MIDI keyboard</b>- this can be played by clicking with a mouse.The midi velocity of the note played is set by the Velocity slider. Middle C is tinted red. Notes that are part of the selected scale are tinted yellow.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Key &amp; Scale button</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Key</b> - C to B.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Ignore key, scale follows played note - for fixed chord shapes</b> - when on, this means that any note played will be valid and the selected scale will be used as the key for all chords generated. For example, if the scale were Major, then all chords generated from notes played will be Major chords.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When this is off, then chords will depend on where the played note is within the scale in the selected key only. So for example, in the scale of C Major, when a D note is played a triad chord created would be a D Minor triad( i.e. D, F &amp; A), since it is forced to be within the notes of the C Major scale.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Scale</b> -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>various options showing scale names and notes per octave.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Silence notes played outside the scale</b> - if off, outside notes will be transposed to the nearest note in the scale.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Transp Octs</b> - transposes all played notes up or down number of octaves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>MIDI keyboard</b>- this can be played by clicking with a mouse.The midi velocity of the note played is set by the Velocity slider. Middle C is tinted red. Notes that are part of the selected scale are tinted yellow.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Chord button</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Play Chord</b> - if on, chords instead of single notes will be output when the module is triggered.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Open Chord</b> - spreads the chord by transposing selected notes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Inversion</b> - changes the note order by transposing the selected number notes up or down one octave<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Randomise vel</b> - adds random variation the velocity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Velocity</b> <b>scale</b> - if less than 1, all chord notes will have their velocity scaled down.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Scale note velocities to played velocity</b> - this will scale all chord notes using the played note’s velocity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Use played velocity for note 1 </b>- this overrides the note settings. (This might be useful for example, if “Randomise velocity note order” is on, to make sure that the root of the chord is as played.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Use probability 100% for note 1 </b>- this overrides the note settings. (Again, this might be useful for example, if “Randomise probability note order” is on, to make sure that the root of the chord is always played.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Randomise velocity note order </b>- this randomly orders the velocity of all the selected notes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Randomise probability note order</b>-<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>this randomly orders the probability of all the selected notes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Chord presets</b> - some standard chord shapes setting which notes are played.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Notes 1-12, Oct+, Oct-<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> - which notes will play in the chord.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Open transp</b> - when Open Chord is selected, certain notes in the chord will be transposed as selected.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Velocity</b> - for each note.</span></p>
