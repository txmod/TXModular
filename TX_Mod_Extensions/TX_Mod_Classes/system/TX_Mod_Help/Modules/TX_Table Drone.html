<p class="p1"><b>Table Drone</b></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Module type: Audio Source (mono output)</b></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Introduction:</i></b></p>
<p class="p1">This module outputs a synthesised waveform as a mono audio signal using wavetable synthesis, with optional sync, phase and frequency modulation. </p>
<p class="p1">Wavetables are single waveforms made up from a mixture of different harmonics. You can draw the harmonic levels for each wavetable or run various processes to create new wavetables. </p>
<p class="p1">This module can move between different wavetables to create smoothly changing waveforms.</p>
<p class="p1">There are 8 wavetables which can each be filled with a mix of up to 32 harmonics.</p>
<p class="p1">There are 5 banks which can be used to store and load sets of wavetables.</p>
<p class="p1">To modify the basic waveform, various phase processes can be optionally added:</p>
<p class="p1">Oscillator sync can reverse or reset the phase, using an internal oscillor or an external signal.  </p>
<p class="p1">Phase modulation by biasing the phase rate can add distortion to the signal shape.  </p>
<p class="p1">Frequency Modulation can also be added, using an external audio signal to modulate the phase.  </p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Controls:</i></b></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Wavetables</b> <b>button</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Wavetables 1-8</b> - buttons to display the harmonics and waveforms of each wavetable.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Harmonics</b> - a row of sliders which set the proportion of each of 8-32 harmonics. Drag across with a mouse to set values.<br>
Behind the sliders, the wavetable signal is shown and it will change whenever the harmonic levels change.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Copy/Paste</b> - for copying between different wavetables.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Reset</b> - sets all harmonics to zero in current wavetable.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Load bank 1/2/3/4/5</b> - these buttons can be used to load wavetables stored in banks 1-5. Banks are places to store all 8 wavetables - they are useful for keeping wavetables during experimentation. </p>
<p class="p1"><b>Store bank 1/2/3/4/5</b> - these buttons can be used to store wavetables in banks 1-5.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>No. harmonics</b> - sets the number of harmonics from a choice of 8, 16, 24 or 32.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Harmonic gap</b> - normally the gap between each harmonic is <b>1</b>, so the frequency of the 2nd harmonic is 2 times the first harmonic, and the 3rd harmonic is 3 times the first. Change this to other values to get different timbres (these are often sound more "buzzy" than with a gap of 1).The range of possible values is 0-3.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Scaling</b> - This emphasises the difference between louder and quiter harmonics. Higher values create more of a difference - i.e quieter harmonics become much quieter. The default value is 1. The range of possible values is 1-5.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Table position</b> - sets which wavetable, or mixture of wavetables, is being used for synthesis.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Stepping</b> - if set to "None", there will be smooth changes in the waveform as the table position is moved. Otherwise, the changes will be stepped. The higher the value, the bigger the changes between steps. Stepping can be used for creative effects.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Level</b> - sets the output level.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Amp Comp</b> - select a preset for the type of amplitude compensation to use - see help file <A href="TX_Amp Comp.html">Amp Comp<A> for details. Can be set to off when not needed.</p>
<p class="p1"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Processes</b> <b>button</b> -<b> </b>there are various processes which can be run on some or all of the wavetables to create a new set of wavetables. </p>
<p class="p1">Some processes transform the current wavetables, others generate completely new wavetables.</p>
<p class="p1">For all processes, you can decide how much of the original wavetable is mixed with the new one. </p>
<p class="p1">This can be useful, for example, if you want to add a small amount of randomness to the harmonic values of the wavetables. You could achieve this by using the process "Generate: random harmonic levels" and using a small mix percent (e.g. 5 percent).</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Wavetables 1-8</b> - see above.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Harmonics</b> - see above.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Copy/Paste</b> - see above.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Reset</b> - see above.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Load bank 1/2/3/4/5</b> - see above. </p>
<p class="p1"><b>Store bank 1/2/3/4/5</b> - see above.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Process</b> - sets the process</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Processing parameters - start &amp; end values</b> - each processing parameter has two values which will be used for the first and last wavetables selected. </p>
<p class="p1">For example if wavetables 3-6 are selected for processing, then the start value will apply to wavetable 3 and the end value to wavetable 6. </p>
<p class="p1">All wavetables in between will have proportionate amounts in between the start and end values.</p>
<p class="p1">For examples of this, try running the various processes marked "Generate" using the default parameter values.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Run Process</b> - button to run the process on the selected wavetables</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Wavetables</b> - select which wavetables will be processed.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Mix percent</b> - of the original and processed wavetables will be mixed together. 100 percent mix will mean only processed wavetables. </p>
<p class="p1"><b>other parameters</b> - processes may have other parameters which will be labelled. These all have start and end values.</p>
<p class="p1"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Base Frequency button</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Base Freq</b> - sets the pitch or frequency of the waveform </p>
<p class="p1"><b>OFF/ON Use note list instead of variable frequency </b>- if set on, this uses a specific note list which the waveform's frequency is chosen from. The controls below allow you to specify the which notes will be in the note list.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Chord/ Scale </b>- sets the interval, scale, mode or chord used for the note list.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Key / root </b>- sets the key or root of the above scale.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Note range </b>- sets the min and max of notes in the note list using midi note numbers.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Note count </b>- shows the total number of notes in the current note list.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Note select </b>- this slider selects one of the notes in the current note list. The lowest note is with the slider set to 0, with the highest at 1, and all others in between.The more notes there are in the note list, the more closely they will be packed along the length of the slider. This can be modulated, for example with an lfo or midi controller.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Freq Smoothing button</b></p>
<p class="p1">This allows you to add smoothing to the frequency parameter.</p>
<p class="p1">See help file <a href="file:../Modules/TX_Smooth.html">Smooth</a></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Sync PD FM Smooth button</b>  </p>
<p class="p1"><b>Sync mode </b>- sets the type of sync, options are:<br>
Sync Off<br>
Reverse phase on cycle start & on sync trigger<br>
Reset phase on cycle start, reverse phase on sync trigger<br>
Reset phase on cycle start & on sync trigger</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Sync trigger </b>- sets the source of sync triggers, options are:<br>
Internal - use [Sync ratio x Base freq] as sync frequency<br>
External Sync audio input on upwards slope<br>
External Sync audio input on downwards slope<br>
External Sync audio input on upwards or downwards slope</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Sync freq </b>- sets the frequency of the internal sync oscillator</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Sync ratio </b>- sets the frequency ratio of the internal sync oscillator</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Sync threshold </b>- sets the minimum level which the phase must be at for a sync trigger to work.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Add Phase Distortion (PD) </b>- introduces changes to the phase rate so the centre of the phase is earlier or later in the cycle</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Phase Distort </b>- sets the amount of forwards or backwards bias</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Frequency Modulation using FM input</b> - If set on, the FM Input audio side-chain input bus will be used to modulate the phase of the waveform, scaled by FM depth. </p>
<p class="p1"><b>FM depth </b>- scales the amount of modulation</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Smooth filter </b>- 2 types of filter are available, a Median filter or a Smoothing filter which use the previous 3-31 audio samples to smooth the output. Each has a different sound.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Audio Input Busses:</i></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>FM input</b> - the incoming mono audio signal used for frequency modulation (if switched on).</p>
