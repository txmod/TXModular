<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This module is based on a SuperCollider model of the Wiard Noise Ring. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It outputs random values in a sequence which can loop or gradually change in a controlled way. Also, the tendency for high or low output values can be controlled.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This module can be triggered in various ways such as by modulation of the Trigger input by a <b>Clock Pulse</b> module, by an <b>Action Sequencer</b> or by action buttons on an interface screen. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Trigger</b> - triggers the next value</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Reset</b> - resets the noise ring values to 0.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Trigger when reset</b> - if set on, a reset will automatically trigger a new value </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Bits</b> - The more bits used, the higher the resolution of the output signal. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">e.g. 1 bit allows only 2 possible output values: 0 &amp; 1. 2 bits = 4 values. 3 bits = 8 values… 8 bits = 256 values… 16 bits = 65536 values. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Change Prob</b> - the probability that a new value will be generated </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>High Prob</b> - the probability that the new value will be high</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In latter model synthesizers, digital noise sources began to appear in place of analog ones. Traditionally, a psuedo-random shift register set up for optimal length. By optimal length, it is meant that every state of all available bits will appear at some time, but the order is unknown. Essentially a counter that counts in an unknown order. This represents the maximum state of information "entropy" available for that number of bits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But music has close self-similarity over short periods of time. That is, it repeats itself with changes appearing slowly. This shift register generator is designed to give control of the rate of appearance of new information. It has a tight set of controls over how random it actually is and how fast change occurs.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Noisering Analysis by Babaluma</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Comparator</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“In electronics, a comparator is a device which compares two voltages or currents and switches its output to indicate which is larger.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Noisering has two comparators: one to determine the Chance value and to determine the Change value. The output of a comparator is 0 or 1.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Shift register</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“In digital circuits, a shift register is a cascade of flip flops, sharing the same clock, which has the output of any one but the last flip-flop connected to the "data" input of the next one in the chain, resulting in a circuit that shifts by one position the one-dimensional "bit array" stored in it, shifting in the data present at its input and shifting out the last bit in the array, when enabled to do so by a transition of the clock input.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Noisering has one 8-bit shift register. The state of the register is translated by two DACs into a voltage in the range of 0-10 volts. One DAC (output 1) provides 256 voltage values, the other (output 2) provides 9 voltage values. ‘00000000’ is the shift register state that represents 0V, ‘11111111’ is the shift register state that represents 10V.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The shift register ‘shifts bits’ at a rate determined by the Rate pot or at a rate determined by the clock input.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Chance</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Chance pot by default attenuates an internal DC voltage. You can also supply a voltage via the Chance input. In either case the Chance voltage is compared against the voltage of an internal analog noise source. If the Chance voltage is greater than the analog noise voltage, the Chance comparator output is 1. If the Chance voltage is smaller than the analog noise voltage, the Chance comparator output is 0.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This means the more clockwise you turn the Chance pot, the greater the Chance voltage, the greater the chance the output of the Chance comparator is 1. The output of the Chance comparator is used as a ‘new value’ for the shift register input.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Change</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Change comparator works exactly the same way: an internal DC voltage or a voltage supplied via the Change input is attenuated by the Change pot and this voltage gets compared to the analog noise voltage. The output of the Change comparator determines if the shift register input gets a ‘new value’ (Change comparator output is 1), or an ‘old value’ (Change comparator output is 0).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A ‘new value’ is the output of the Chance comparator. An ‘old value’ is the last bit from the shift register. This bit gets recycled so to speak.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In practice this means that when the Change pot is turned fully counter clockwise, the input of the shift register only gets values from the last bit. This results in a repeating pattern in the shift register. If you monitor one of the DAC outputs at audio rate you will here a steady tuned tone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The more clockwise you turn the Change pot, the more new values will arrive at shift register input, which leads to ever more changing patterns in the shift register.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another worthy thing to note: the more the shift register is occupied by zeros, the greater the chance the DACs output a low voltage (‘00000000’ represents 0V). And of course the more the shift register is occupied by ones, the greater the chance the DACs output a high voltage.</span></p>
