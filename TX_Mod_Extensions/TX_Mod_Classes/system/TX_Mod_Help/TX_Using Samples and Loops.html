<p class="p3"><b>Using Samples and Loops</b></p>
<p class="p3">In order to use samples or loops, you need to add them into a <b>Sample Bank</b> or <b>Loop Bank</b>. </p>
<p class="p3">To open the relevent window<b> </b>use <b>Sample Banks</b> and <b>Loop Banks</b> buttons near the top of the window.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Sample Banks</b> </p>
<p class="p3">There are <b>99 banks</b> available. You can give a <b>name</b> to the banks you use.</p>
<p class="p3">Each bank holds stereo and mono samples for use by modules such as <b>Sample Player</b>, <b>Sample Player+</b>, <b>Granulator, </b>and<b> Convolution.</b></p>
<p class="p3">Use the <b>Drag & drop to add</b> box or <b>Add Samples</b> button to add one or more aiff or wave files to the current Sample Bank.</p>
<p class="p3">With other buttons, you can <b>search</b> a chosen folder for missing samples, <b>save</b> the current sample bank to disk, for use by other systems, <b>load</b> banks from disk into your current banks, <b>play</b> samples, <b>remove </b>individual<b> </b>samples from the bank, <b>replace </b> samples, or <b>empty</b> the entire bank.</p>
<p class="p3">You can <b>select</b> samples within the bank and see their length (in milliseconds) and the number of channels. </p>
<p class="p3">You can also tell the system the <b>midi note</b> or <b>frequency</b> (i.e. pitch in cycles per second) of specific samples in the bank if you know them. This enables the samples to automatically play in tune when you use them in Sample Players. </p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Loop Banks</b></p>
<p class="p3">There are <b>99 banks</b> available. You can give a <b>name</b> to the banks you use.</p>
<p class="p3">Each bank holds stereo and mono samples for use by <b>Loop Player</b> modules<b>.</b></p>
<p class="p3">It is very similar to the Sample Bank, except that for loops you set the <b>total number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beats</b> in the loop. Once this is set, the <b>BPM</b> of the loop (based on the loop time and total no. of beats) will be shown so you can check that it is correct. </p>
<p class="p3">If you change the <b>BPM</b> the <b>Total beats</b> will be calculated automatically.</p>
<p class="p3">Note: Take care to set the correct number of beats for each loop used so that Loop Players will play back the loops at the correct BPM.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Using mono and stereo samples or loops</b></p>
<p class="p3">When you use a <b>mono</b> <b>Sample Player</b> or <b>Loop Player</b>, it will only allow you to select <b>mono</b> samples or loops from the bank. </p>
<p class="p3">However, the <b>stereo</b> Sample and Loop Players will allow you to select <b>mono <i>and</i> stereo </b>samples or loops.</p>
<p class="p3">You can tell whether a sample or loop is mono or stereo by selecting it in the sample or loop bank and checking the <b>number of channels</b> displayed.</p>
