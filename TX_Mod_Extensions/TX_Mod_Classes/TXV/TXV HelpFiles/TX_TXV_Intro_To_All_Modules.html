<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>See also: <A href="TX_TXV_List_Of_All_Modules.html">TXV List Of All Modules<A></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>System</i></b></p>
<p class="p1"><A href="TX_TXV System.html">TXV System<A> [ModulationSource DrawDestination]<br>
This module is used to control a separate piece of software - TXV - which is a modular video system for generating real-time 2D & 3D visuals. </p>
<p class="p1">TXV opens in it’s own window and is controlled by the TXV System module running in the TX Modular. <br>
Internally, OSC network messages are used to communicate between the TXV System module and TXV software.</p>
<p class="p1">TXV was created to enable the TX Modular system to control both video and audio processes.<br>
Like the TX Modular, TXV includes various types of modules:<br>
- <b>Draw Sources</b> such as image file, movie file, live video camera, 3D Model file, 2D/3D shapes.<br>
- <b>Draw Destinations</b> include the TXV System,Transform (shift/ scale/ rotate) and Transf3DMulti  (transform & multiply drawn objects), Scene (3D Scene with camera & lights).<br>
- <b>Modulation sources</b> include LFOs, Perlin noise,  and a step sequencer.<br>
- <b>Image FX</b> include Blend, Blur, Pixelate and Colorize.<br>
(See “TXV Intro To All Modules” for a full list).</p>
<p class="p1">There are various ways to connect modules together:<br>
- <b>Draw Connections</b> connect Draw Source modules to Draw Destination modules, including the TX System module which draws to the main window.<br>
- <b>Modulation Nodes</b> connect modulation sources to parameters in other modules.<br>
- Lastly, the various modules that use images have the option to directly import the image produced by any other image module.</p>
<p class="p1">Note: The TXV software should be started before trying to connect to the TXV System module.</p>
<p class="p1"><A href="TX_TXV DrawConnection.html">TXV DrawConnection<A>  <br>
This module connects a Draw Source module to a particular draw layer in a Draw Destination module (which all have 20 draw layers).<br>
Whenever the Draw Destination module draws that particular layer, the Draw Source module will be drawn. <br>
Multiple draw sources can be connected to each layer of a Draw Destination module. <br>
To draw to the main window, the final Draw Destination needs to be the TX System module.<br>
Chains of draw connections can be made, for example connecting an Image module to a Transform module to scale & rotate it & connecting the Transform module to the TXV System to display it. </p>
<p class="p1"><A href="TX_TXV Node.html">TXV Node<A>  <br>
This module connects a modulation source to a parameter in another module so it can be modulated.<br>
Negative modulation, which is optional, will invert the modulation signal.</p>
