TX Modular System

The TX Modular System is open source audio-visual software for modular synthesis and video generation.

It comes is 2 parts: the main TX Modular System and audio engine are built with SuperCollider (https://supercollider.github.io).
TXV, the visual engine, is a separate app built with openFrameworks (https://openframeworks.cc).

There are various ways to install TX and TXV on different platforms. The following can be downloaded from http://palemoonrising.co.uk:

- TX Modular MacOS standalone for Mojave (10.14) or earlier
Standalone TX Modular app that includes SuperCollider & TXV within it.
The standalone will only work with Mojave (10.14) or earlier (10.11, 10.12 & 10.13) - but NOT Catalina (10.15) or later.

- TX Modular SuperCollider code
The main TX Modular system and audio engine in the form of SuperCollider code that can be added to SuperCollider. This should work with all recent versions of MacOS, Windows and Linux platforms with SuperCollider & SC3 Plugins installed.

- TXV app, builds for MacOS and Windows
The TXV visual engine, which is a separate app that connects to the TX Modular System.
There are builds for  MacOS and Windows.
The TXV build for MacOS will only work with Mojave (10.14) or earlier (10.11, 10.12 & 10.13) - but NOT Catalina (10.15) or later.
Building TXV on Linux is currently untested.

- TXV sources for openFrameworks 0.9.8
To use the TXV visual engine on Linux or MacOS Catalina (version 10.15) or later, it should hopefully be possible to compile TXV from source code on these platforms using openFrameworks 0.9.8 and selected Addons. (Note: compiling on these platforms is currently untested).
